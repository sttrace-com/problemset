Your team just released a new API to production. Five minutes after the release, one of your teammate says that he is not seeing any data on the UI. As the DevOps engineer on the team, you decide to look into this issue.

You've SSHed into the production server to see what's wrong, you realize that you dont have the required root permission to kill the running API. Can you fix the issue?

**Note:** The API is expected to run on `localhost` on port `5000`.

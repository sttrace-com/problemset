You are working on a new API project. Youâ€™ve created a Git repository and now want to set up a very simple API endpoint to test your local environment. Make the following changes inside the current `api` directory.

### Changes
- Create a new `GET` endpoint `/ping`.
- Update the configuration so the API server runs on port `8080`.
- Create a new commit on the branch named `dev`, with the commit message:  
  `feat: add new /ping endpoint`
- Run the API on `localhost:8080`.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All changes must be on the `dev` branch in single commit.
- The commit message must match the required format.
- The API should be accessible on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Notes
- You have `sudo` access to install packages, e.g., `sudo apt install vim`.

You are given a tar file `files.tar.gz`.

It contains multiple log files with randomized data. Your job is to create `results.txt` and store line count of each file along with its file name.  

#### **Expected `results.txt` format**
```text title="results.txt"
911 log_file_1.txt
801 log_file_2.txt
713 log_file_10.txt
...
```

**Note :** The order in which you store the records in `results.txt` does not matter.

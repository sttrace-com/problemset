It's Friday night but you are on-call.  
You get a call saying the release pipeline is failing. It's an important release so you ssh into the release server. There you see `release_pipeline.sh` and `releases` directory.  
Apparently, it’s the release_pipeline.sh that’s failing.

How would you investigate and fix this issue?

**Note:** You have access to `vim`

You are given multiple files in `files` directory. All the files starting with `imp_` are important files.

You need to send these important files to your co-worker. Your co-worker has asked you to send all the important files compressed into a single `imp_files.tar.gz` file.

Filter all the appropriate files and create `imp_files.tar.gz`.
